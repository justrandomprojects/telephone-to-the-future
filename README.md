telephone-to-the-future
=======================

Code for my project converting a rotary phone to dtmf dialling.

Files:

LCD-Rotary-Dial.ino
  This file contains the initial sketch and code to make an arduino count rotary dial pulses and 
  display the number on an LCD display.
  The breadboard was set up with two digital read pins, two 10k resistors, one 104 capacitor.
  The sketch is well commented to give you more information as to what leads from your rotary
  dial piece you will need to attach where.
  More information can be found in my blog post regarding this stage of the project:
